        "designed": " 'There were too many out of the ordinary circumstances for it to be ''luck'' or ''chance''. I fully believe this was carefully designed and orchestrated by a loving God.' -Sarah",

        "beginning": " Sarah and Manuel met while Sarah was visiting the Dominican Republic. The two realized they had a lot in common and shared similar interests and goals. Their connection grew stronger even after Sarah returned to the U.S. Being in two different countries was hard, and Manuel knew he wanted to bridge that gap and be with the woman he fell in love with.",
        "proposal": "The proposal: Sarah went to visit Manuel after she graduated. It just so happened to be her birthday weekend when she arrived. On her birthday Manuel planned a fun day at her favorite place, the beach. At the end of day they headed back to the motel. When Sarah entered she saw the room decorated for her birthday! That's when Manuel gave her the best present by asking her to marry him!",
        "titleHer": "About Sarah:",
        "she": "Sarah is from sunny California. She has a passion for traveling and learning about new cultures. She recently graduated in Software Development.

        "titleHim": "About Manuel:",
        "he": "Manuel was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. He has two sons ages 14 and 4 who are the center of his life. A jack of all trades, if it requires your hands, Manuel can do it! A true Dominicano, Manuel loves to dance and music.",
        "titleThem": "How they feel:",
        "aboutHim": " 'I never could have imagined finding a man like Manuel. He is sweet, loving, caring and has the softest, kindest soul. On top of all of that he treats me like I am truly a treasure to him. I feel so grateful and honored that he chose me.' -Sarah",
        "they": "The two will be marrying on May 30th, and from there will begin their 'happily ever after' in Santo Domingo."

        "title": "Registry",
        "summary": "Starting a new life in a new country is not only exciting and scary, it's a learning experience. The Dominican Republic is an amazing country and some of the things we are used to in the United States are not the same there.",
        "explain": "For instance, when you rent an apartment in the United States it comes with all major appliances. In the Dominican Republic, you need to provide your own appliances. We will need to provide our own refrigerator and stove. If we want air conditioning (which trust me, if Manuel wants to live through our first year of marriage, we NEED a/c) we need to purchase it ourselves and install it. Due to the humidity there, window units are not effective. They use wall mounted units which are notedly more expensive than window units. For this reason, we have decided to forgo a typical wedding registry such as Target or Bed Bath & Beyond. We are asking for your generous help to purchase the appliances we need for our home.",
        "thankful": "We truly appreciate any and all support from you. No amount is too small. The exchange rate is great for the American dollar. Even what you might think is a small donation can really help. Below we have provided ways for you to donate whatever you can. If you cannot donate through the means provided, feel free to contact us for other ideas. We are humbled by all of the love and support you continue to show to us and are excited to start this chapter of our lives together.  "
